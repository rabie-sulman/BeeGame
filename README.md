# BeeGame
a game which I wrote (within 2 hours or so) as part of a coding test for a job interview. This was 2015 and I used Slim 2 framework and sessions. 

I added a docker compose for ease of run, I used on the (php docker example I wrote)[https://github.com/rabie-sulman/php_docker_example]

to run: 
```sh
    > docker-compose run --rm php composer install
    > docker-compose up --build -d
```
go to the `localhost`
